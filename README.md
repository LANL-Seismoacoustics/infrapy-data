# infrapy-data
Data used in some of the Examples/Tutorials/Command Line Interface scripts

Installation:
Infrapy will expect to see this data in a folder in its base directory. So in a terminal, navigate to the base 
directory of your infrapy installation, and download the data via:

    >> git clone git clone git@github.com:LANL-Seismoacoustics/infrapy-data.git
    
This should create a folder named infrapy-data at that spot and download the necessary data files.
